### 2.3 Advanced Sensors (3 days)
- **Goal**: Enhanced sensor capabilities
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Add presence sensor support
  - [ ] Implement sensor configuration updates
  - [ ] Add relative rotary events from dimmers
  - [ ] Create sensor threshold management
- **Files**: Update `hue/sensor.go`, `mcp/sensor.go`
- **Why**: Better automation triggers

## Phase 3: Platform Features (1-2 weeks)

- **Why**: System administration features

### 3.2 Geolocation (2 days)
- **Goal**: Location-based automation
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Add geofence client management
  - [ ] Implement location triggers
  - [ ] Create home/away automation tools
- **Files**: Create `hue/geolocation.go`
- **Why**: Popular for energy saving

### 3.3 Matter/HomeKit (3 days)
- **Goal**: Smart home integration
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Add Matter configuration support
  - [ ] Implement HomeKit resource management
  - [ ] Create integration status tools
- **Files**: Create `hue/integrations.go`
- **Why**: Future-proofing for smart home standards

## Phase 4: Polish & Optimization (1 week)

### 4.1 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Add request caching where appropriate
- [ ] Optimize batch command processing
- [ ] Profile and reduce memory usage

### 4.2 Error Handling & Recovery
