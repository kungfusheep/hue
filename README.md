## Prerequisites

1. Go 1.21 or later
2. Philips Hue Bridge with v2 API support
3. Hue Bridge API username (see setup below)

## Setup

### 1. Get Your Hue Bridge IP and Username

Find your bridge IP:
```bash
curl https://discovery.meethue.com/
```

Get an API username:
```bash
# Press the link button on your Hue Bridge, then run:
curl -X POST http://<BRIDGE_IP>/api -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"devicetype":"hue#claude"}'
```

### 2. Build the MCP Server

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kungfusheep/hue.git
cd hue

# Build the binary
go build -o hue
```

### 3. Set Environment Variables

```bash
export HUE_BRIDGE_IP="192.168.1.100"  # Your bridge IP
export HUE_USERNAME="your-api-username-here"
```

### 4. Configure Claude Desktop (example)

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hue": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/hue",
      "env": {
        "HUE_BRIDGE_IP": "YOUR_BRIDGE_IP",
        "HUE_USERNAME": "YOUR_API_USERNAME"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Restart Claude Desktop

Quit and restart Claude Desktop to load the new configuration.

## CLI Usage

The `hue` binary functions as both an MCP server and a standalone CLI tool:

```bash
# Run as MCP server (for Claude Desktop)
hue

# Run CLI commands directly
hue <command>

# Examples:
hue lights list
hue lights on "Office Lamp"
hue lights color "Office Lamp" blue
hue lights brightness "Office Lamp" 50

# Group control
hue groups list
hue groups on "Living Room"
hue groups color "Kitchen" warm
hue groups rooms  # List all rooms

# Effects
hue effects flash "Office Lamp" --color red --count 3
hue effects pulse "Bedroom Light" --min 10 --max 90
hue effects stop <sequence-id>

# Native Hue scenes
hue hue-scenes list
hue hue-scenes activate "Relax"

# Cached scenes (from MCP)
hue scenes list
hue scenes recall "alien_artifact_discovery"

# Sensors
hue sensors motion     # List motion sensors
hue sensors temperature # List temperature sensors
hue sensors light      # List light level sensors

# Real-time event streaming
hue stream             # Stream all events
hue stream -f motion   # Stream only motion events
hue stream -f "motion,temperature"  # Multiple event types
hue stream -r          # Show raw JSON events

# Batch commands
hue batch -f commands.json
```

The CLI supports friendly names for all lights and rooms - no need to use UUIDs!

## MCP Usage Examples

Once configured, you can ask Claude to:

### Basic Control
- "Turn on all office lights"
- "Set the living room to candle effect"

### Advanced Control
- "Create a custom sequence that fades from red to blue over 10 seconds"
- "Run a party mode with strobe effects"
- "Show me all running light effects"
- "Stop all light animations"

### Sensors & Automation

## Key Features Explained

### üöÄ Non-blocking Operations
All lighting commands execute asynchronously by default. This means:
- Claude responds immediately while lights change in the background
- You can stack multiple effects on different lights
- Complex sequences won't freeze the conversation
- Use `async: false` in batch commands if you need to wait

### üé≠ Effects System
The MCP includes a powerful effects engine:
- **Pre-built effects** for common scenarios (alerts, ambiance, parties)
- **Custom sequences** for precise choreography
- **Parallel execution** - run multiple effects simultaneously
- **Loop support** - effects can repeat indefinitely
- See [EFFECTS_GUIDE.md](EFFECTS_GUIDE.md) for detailed examples

### üíæ Scene Caching for RPGs
Perfect for game masters who need instant atmosphere changes:

**First time - Create and cache:**
```
"Set up mysterious alien artifact discovery lighting"
‚Üí Claude creates complex 15-command sequence with purple/blue colors, pulsing, flickering
‚Üí Automatically caches as "alien_artifact_discovery"
```

**Later in the game - Instant recall:**
```
"Recall the alien artifact scene"
‚Üí Instantly recreates the exact same atmosphere
```

Features:
- Cache complex multi-command scenes with `cache_name` in batch_commands
- Instant recall with `recall_scene`
- Track usage with `list_cached_scenes`
- Export scenes for sharing with other GMs
- Scenes persist throughout your Claude session

### üîÑ Real-time Events
Subscribe to live updates from your Hue system:
- Motion sensor triggers
- Button presses
- Light state changes
- Temperature updates

## Troubleshooting

1. **"Failed to connect to Hue bridge"**
   - Verify your bridge IP is correct
   - Ensure your API username is valid
   - Check you're on the same network as the bridge

2. **"Light/group not found"**
   - Use `list_lights` or `list_groups` to see available IDs
   - Light names are case-sensitive

3. **Effects not working**
   - Not all lights support all effects
   - Use dynamic effect discovery to see supported effects

## Development

Run tests:
```bash
go test ./...
```

Run comprehensive test suite:
```bash
# Set environment variables first
go run test_comprehensive.go
```

## Development Status

This MCP server provides comprehensive coverage of the Philips Hue v2 API (90%+):
- ‚úÖ Complete light, group, scene, and room control
- ‚úÖ Full sensor integration
- ‚úÖ Real-time event streaming
- ‚úÖ Advanced effects and sequencing
- ‚úÖ Non-blocking asynchronous operations
- üöß Entertainment streaming (DTLS foundation implemented, full streaming in progress)
