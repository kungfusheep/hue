## üí® Speed Tricks

1. **Parallel Implementation**
   - Open multiple files
   - Implement related features simultaneously
   - Use Go's interfaces for clean separation

2. **Copy-Adapt Pattern**
   - Reuse existing patterns from completed features
   - Adapt sensor code for new sensor types
   - Clone CRUD patterns across resources

3. **Test-As-You-Go**
   - Write simple test files like we did before
   - Test with your actual bridge immediately
   - Fix issues in real-time

## üéØ Realistic Goals

**By End of Day 1**: 
- Real-time events flowing
- Full CRUD working
- Basic entertainment mode

**By End of Day 2**:
- All advanced features implemented
- Automation working
- 80%+ coverage achieved

**By End of Day 3**:
- Platform features complete
- Everything polished
- 90%+ coverage achieved

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Let's Start NOW!

Want me to start with Event Streaming right now? I can probably have it working within the next hour, then we can test it with your motion sensors and move on to the next feature.

The whole roadmap? More like a weekend project at this pace! üöÄ
